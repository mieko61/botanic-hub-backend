    description:
      "Ephedra is a stimulant that has caused heart attack and stroke resulting in several deaths.Ephedra contains ephedrine and pseudoephedrine,which are known to stimulate the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). They activate the fight or flight response, resulting in constriction of blood vessels, relaxation and dilation of air passages, appetite suppression, and general stimulant effects. While these effects explain the use of ephedra as a decongestant, weight loss supplement, and anti-asthma agent, in high doses ephedra can raise blood pressure and cause adverse reactions such as stroke and heart attack. Even a single dose of an ephedra containing supplement can cause dangerous increases in blood pressure and effects on heart function. Laboratory studies indicate that ephedra also can kill bacteria on contact, reduce inflammation, and cause contraction of the muscles of the uterus. These effects have not been studied in humans.",

The seeds of the chia plant are rich in fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and alpha-linolenic acid, a type of essential fatty acid. They are thought to be useful for reducing risk of heart disease and as an aid in weight management. Data from a few small studies suggest that chia seeds may be helpful for patients with diabetes or help contribute to feelings of fullness, but chia did not appear to affect weight loss. In addition, reviews of the current evidence do not adequately support these claims. Larger well-designed trials are needed.",

Saw palmetto berry extracts also reduce inflammation and swelling by preventing the formation of compounds that cause these reactions. In a laboratory study, a saw palmetto extract was found to slow the growth of normal prostate cells and increase their sensitivity to radiation, while not affecting prostate cancer cells. Since this may increase the risk of complications, patients should consult with a physician before using saw palmetto supplements during radiation therapy.",

Alfalfa seeds also contain a toxic amino acid, L-canavanine. Levels of this amino acid vary widely across various cultivations of plants, and decrease as the plant matures.
